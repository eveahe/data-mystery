    <h1>~Mystery Data~</h1>
    
    <p>
      How well do you know your data? Test yourself, your friends or your colleagues. <b>Upload a csv to start!</b> Ideally choose one with more than a couple of fields and roll the dice to see if you can define what the field means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try five mysteries! If at least 3 have you stumped, consider creating documentation or a <a href="https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/10/30/data-dictionaries/">data dictionary</a> on where the data comes from and what it represents! Don't let data be misunderstood.

      Some notes about the data mystery game above.
      <ol>
        <li>This game was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/thejunglejane/status/1107836327100338177">this tweet</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/thejunglejane">@thejunglejane</a> and was remixed from Glitch's <a href="https://starter-d3-dsv.glitch.me/">d3 CSV parse challenge app.</a></li>
        <li>Any CSV you upload is processed on the client side only (aka is not saved). This means that you can't share a link with a friend _after_ you've uploaded, but wouldn't it be more fun to play together anyway? But for real, this is mostly so I didn't need to worry about any file security issuess.</li>
        <li>After about ~8 years of working in data companies or on data-related teams, I both 1) distrust all data and 2) believe in documentation, even if it's just for you.</li>
        <li>Made by <a href="https://twitter.com/eveahe">@eveahe</a>, all suggestions for improvement welcome! You can remix 4 your own data game.</li>
