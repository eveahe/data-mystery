d3-dsv Starter
=================

ðŸ”— [d3-dsv documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv)

This app uses [d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv) (client-side) to parse a CSV file. d3-dsv is a utility function included as a helper for [d3](https://d3js.org/) (a popular data visualization library) but can be used by itself as well, as seen here.

## How to use it

### 1. Get some data

There are many options for getting CSV data. If you have data in Airtable or Google Sheets or Excel, you can export your data as a CSV and use that file. If you don't have a CSV or spreadsheet handy, download one from somewhere on the internet! Here are some places to look:
  - [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV) aggregates US local, state, and federal datasets for download
  - [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) is another aggregated list of public datasets

If you're feeling stuck with data, try one of these:
- [Los Angeles 2010 Census Populations by Zip Code](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2010-census-populations-by-zip-code)
- [Most Popular Baby Names by Sex and Mother's Ethnic Group, New York City](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/most-popular-baby-names-by-sex-and-mothers-ethnic-group-new-york-city-8c742)
- [New York City Leading Causes of Death](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-leading-causes-of-death-ce97f)
- [City of Seattle Wages: Comparison by Gender - Average Hourly Wage by Age](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-of-seattle-wages-comparison-by-gender-average-hourly-wage-by-age-353b2)

Make sure your CSV has a header row and that it is actually comma-delimited. You can do this by opening the file in a text editor and looking at it that way, or you can try adding it to this app and seeing what happens!

### 2. "Choose File" and add your CSV

If you choose a non-CSV file, the app will yell at you.

### 3. Push the buttons

Once you add a CSV, you will see a JSON-ified version of the data in the black box (the "output") on the left side of the page along with some buttons on the right side of the page.

- **Count rows** will print the number of rows in the CSV to the output
- **Get fields** will print a list of fields in the CSV to the output
- The **Sort by...** dropdown menu will sort the JSON by the selected field

### 4. Remix this app!

See the next section for extending this app and making it your own.

## Development - Getting started

First of all, remix this app! Remixing will create your own copy of the app that is unique to you -- any changes you make will only apply to your version. Make sure you change the description in your version so you remember what the app does when you're looking at it later.

Here are some ways you can customize this app to make it your own:

1. Add a toggle for sorting the JSON in ascending order or descending order
2. Add a "pivot" option for turning rows into columns and columns into rows -- for example, see this [Department of Energy Population by Country](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/population-by-country-1980-2010) dataset
3. Add a button to transform the data to a structure suitable for visualization with [Chart.js](https://glitch.com/~starter-chartjs)
4. Add support for other types of delimiter-separated value files (tabs, semicolons, etc)
5. Add a button to download the transformed/sorted data as a JSON file

## Code

The code powering this app is in `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

### `index.html`

- `d3-dsv` library included in `<head>` via `<script>` tags
- `script.js` and `style.css` are also imported in `<head>`
- in `<body>` there is a `<div>` with `class="row"`
- inside of that `<div>` there are two other `<div>` elements: `id="json-output"` and `id="operations"`
- inside of `id="operations"` there is an `<input>` element with `type="file"`

`<div id="row">` exists so elements inside can be styled with CSS. `<div id="operations">` will contain the buttons and forms that will be used to upload and transform data, including the `<input>` element. `<div id="json-output">` is where the output from those operations will go. More operations will be added to the page via code in `script.js`.

### `style.css`

- add definitions for `.row`, `.left`, and `.right` to make the two columns side-by-side -- these CSS rules use [FlexBox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) for styling
- set a black background and white text for the `json-output` `div` and make sure that a scrollbar appears if the text is too long to fit in the box on the page
- use `@media` queries to change the layout when the screen width is above 768 pixels
- add cool styling to the `input` and `button` elements

### `script.js`

The JavaScript in this app is _event-driven_ -- when an _event_ fires on the page, it triggers a certain piece of code. When you check a box on a web page? A "click" event is fired. Pick from a dropdown menu? A "select" event is fired. In this app, where different things are happening to the data depending on what button is pressed, it makes sense to have individual functions that are triggered when an event happens on the page. The following table lists the names of the functions in this app, what they do, and what behavior triggers or calls them.

Function | Description | Trigger/Call
--- | --- | ---
`loadFile()` | reads the file with `FileReader`, parses the file with `d3-dsv`, calls `printToOutput()` with the parsed file, calls `addButtons()` | triggered on a file being added via the `input` on the page (a `"change"` event)
`addButtons()` | adds buttons and event handlers for those buttons | called from within `loadFile()`
`updateSortBy()` | updates the `Sort by...` dropdown with the fields from the newest-uploaded data | called from within `addButtons()`
`printToOutput()` | sets the inner HTML of the `json-output` div to whatever was passed to it | called from within several functions
`countRows()` | counts the number of rows in the input CSV and calls `printToOutput()` | triggered on a `"click"` event on the "Count rows" button (added in `addButtons()`)
`sortBy()` | sorts the JSON data by selected field and calls `printToOutput()` | triggered on a `"select"` event on the "Sort by" dropdown menu (added in `addButtons()`)
`getFields()` | lists the fields in the input CSV and calls `printToOutput()` | triggered on a `"click"` event on the "Get fields" button (added in `addButtons()`)

See the code comments in `script.js` for more explanation of what's happening in these files.
