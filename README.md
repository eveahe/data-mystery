~ MYSTERY DATA~
=================

Mystery Data is a game to encourage us all to see the mysteries in the data we have lying around. 

By seeing the mysteries (i.e., how difficult it can be to "correctly" interpret a field without context), we can strengthen our health distrust of the data we use and develop practices to document said data. 

This game was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thejunglejane/status/1107836327100338177) by @thejunglejane and was remixed from Glitch's d3 [CSV parse](https://starter-d3-dsv.glitch.me/) challenge app.

## How to use it

### 1. Get some data

If you don't have a CSV handy, download one to play! You can export a Google Sheet or an Excel sheet as a CSV to download. Alternatively, look to open data sources to find a CSV to use. 
  - [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV) aggregates US local, state, and federal datasets for download
  - [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) is another aggregated list of public datasets
  - [Enigma Public](https://public.enigma.com) yet another source for lots of public datasets.

The below is guidance taken from the original CSV parse app, but I think it's good advice to keep: 
Make sure your CSV has a header row and that it is actually comma-delimited. You can do this by opening the file in a text editor and looking at it that way, or you can try adding it to this app and seeing what happens!

### 2. "Choose File" and add your CSV

If you choose a non-CSV file, the app will yell at you.

### 3. Push the buttons

Once you add a CSV, you will see a message saying that your message has been prepared, you can now click "Data Mystery" button to select a random field from your dataset. Can you state confidently what the field represents? Solve the mystery of the data! 

### 4. Change the mode
The game has two modes: hard and easy. In hard mode you will just see the name of a random field from the dataset, no further context given. If you can get stuck you can ask for one hint. Pressing the hint button will give you the contents for that field for a random row in the dataset. 

In easy mode, you will see the both the field name and the data from a random row by default. Note, that sometimes the data for the random row can be null!

### 5. Remix this app!

All further data games appreciated.
